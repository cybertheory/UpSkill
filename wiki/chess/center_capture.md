## When should I use it?

Know this for the opening!

Your pieces should always have influence (direct or indirect) over the center. This is core to classical chess strategy.

Good pawn occupation of the center is never frowned upon.

## Where should I use it?

Use this in the opening and keep in mind for the middle and end game.

Having dominance of the center throughout or at parts of the game can give you more options.

## How do I do it?

Either occupy or threaten center squares. Exchanges in the center should always be set up to go your way.

- Use Pawns: Your Middle 4 pawns can be used to occupy the center or put pressure very early.

- Knights: Try and move your Knights towards - not away - from the center. This way they can support your pawns or capture their own central squares.

- Bishops: Try and aim your Bishops down the center diagnals or support your other pieces in the center.

- Other Pieces: Queens and Rooks can be used to stare down the center, especially later in the game. Get them on open columns or files! The more open the more board they control.

## Why should I do it?

Capturing the center early or vying for its dominance, either gives you or denies the opponent more control of the board.

If you are not doing it or aren't aiming to do it, you will be at a disadvantage.
